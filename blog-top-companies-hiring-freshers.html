        <h2>Why Off-Campus Hiring Is Important for Freshers</h2>

        <p>
          Off-campus hiring allows companies to reach a larger talent pool beyond
          college campuses. For freshers, this means:

        <ul>
          <li>More opportunities irrespective of college tier</li>
          <li>Multiple chances throughout the year</li>
          <li>Exposure to real industry-level recruitment processes</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The companies listed below regularly conduct off-campus drives,
          apprenticeship programs, and fresher hiring initiatives.
