<h1>About NeuraCampus</h1>

<p>
NeuraCampus is a career-focused platform built for Indian students and freshers.
Our goal is to simplify the job search process by providing verified off-campus job opportunities and practical career guidance.

Many students struggle to find reliable job information outside campus placements.
NeuraCampus was created to bridge that gap by sharing genuine job openings, clear role details, and official application links.
</p>

<p>
We do not charge any fees and we do not ask for personal payments.
Our focus is to help freshers make informed career decisions with clarity and confidence.

NeuraCampus is continuously evolving to support students with accurate information, easy navigation, and a trustworthy experience.
